# Excel Pro AI Authorization System Documentation

## Overview

The Excel Pro AI authorization system is a comprehensive security solution that implements role-based access control (RBAC) with JWT-based authentication. This document outlines the key components, configuration, and usage guidelines.

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**
   - User creates an account with email/phone and password
   - Account verification via OTP (email/SMS)
   - Optional MFA setup

2. **User Login**
   - Credentials validation
   - MFA verification (if enabled)
   - JWT token generation (access + refresh tokens)
   - Session creation

3. **Token Management**
   - Access token: 15-minute expiration
   - Refresh token: 7-day expiration
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Device fingerprinting for enhanced security

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### User Roles

| Role    | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Admin   | Full system access with all permissions          |
| User    | Standard access to core features                 |
| Viewer  | Read-only access to data and analytics           |

### Permission Matrix

| Permission          | Admin | User | Viewer |

## Security Features

### Authentication Security

- **Password Security**
  - Secure hashing with bcrypt/Argon2
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Brute force protection

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
  - QR code setup
  - Backup codes for recovery

- **Session Management**
  - Configurable session timeouts
  - Device fingerprinting
  - Trusted device management

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Configurable per-endpoint limits
  - IP-based and user-based limiting
  - Graduated response (warning, temporary block, permanent block)

- **Request Protection**
  - CSRF token validation
  - XSS prevention
  - Input validation and sanitization

- **IP Management**
  - IP whitelisting/blacklisting
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Geolocation-based security

### Audit and Monitoring

- **Comprehensive Logging**
  - Authentication events
  - Permission checks
  - Data access and modifications
  - Security events

- **Security Monitoring**
  - Real-time threat detection
  - Suspicious activity alerts
  - Automatic blocking of malicious activity

## Implementation Components

### Core Services

- **AuthService**: Main authentication service
- **JWTService**: Token generation and validation
- **CryptoService**: Cryptographic operations
- **SecurityService**: Security features and threat detection
- **AuditService**: Logging and monitoring
- **RateLimitService**: Request rate limiting

### React Components

- **AuthProvider**: Context provider for authentication state
- **AuthGuard**: Component for protecting routes
- **PermissionGuard**: Component for permission-based rendering
- **SecuritySettings**: User-facing security configuration

## API Authentication Requirements

All API requests must include:

1. **Authorization Header**:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   ```

2. **CSRF Token** (for mutation operations):
   ```
   X-CSRF-Token: <csrf_token>
   ```

3. **Content Security Headers** (automatically applied):
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
   - Content-Security-Policy: (restrictive policy applied)

## Token Management

### Token Structure

**Access Token Payload**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "user",
  "permissions": ["read:data", "write:data", ...],
  "sessionId": "session_456",
  "deviceFingerprint": "device_789",
  "iat": 1625097600,
  "exp": 1625098500,
  "type": "access"
}
```

**Refresh Token Payload**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "user",
  "permissions": ["read:data", "write:data", ...],
  "sessionId": "session_456",
  "deviceFingerprint": "device_789",
  "iat": 1625097600,
  "exp": 1625702000,
  "type": "refresh"
}
```

### Token Lifecycle

1. **Token Generation**: On successful login
2. **Token Storage**: Secure, encrypted browser storage
3. **Token Usage**: Included in API requests
4. **Token Refresh**: Automatic refresh before expiration
5. **Token Invalidation**: On logout or security event

## Compliance Considerations

The authorization system is designed to comply with:

- **GDPR**: User data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: For healthcare-related applications
- **OWASP**: Following security best practices
- **PCI DSS**: For payment-related features

## Security Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege Principle**: Users have only the permissions they need
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features enabled by default
4. **Fail Secure**: Errors result in denied access, not granted access
5. **Regular Auditing**: Continuous monitoring and review

## Error Handling

All authentication and authorization errors return appropriate HTTP status codes:

- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication failure
- 403 Forbidden: Authorization failure
- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded

Error responses include detailed messages for debugging while maintaining security.
